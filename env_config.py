"""
env_config.py
--------------
Reads a `.env` file sitting next to the scripts, so credentials live in one
place instead of being retyped into every command line.

Two reasons this is hand-rolled rather than `python-dotenv`:

1. **No new dependency.** Every engine here already refuses to be a heavy
   install, and a credential loader is about thirty lines. If `python-dotenv`
   *is* installed it gets used instead, so a project that already depends on it
   keeps its own behaviour.
2. **A secret in argv is visible to anything that can run `ps`.** Passing
   `--twocaptcha-key sk_live_...` leaks the key to every other process on the
   machine and into shell history. Reading it from the environment does not.

Precedence, highest first:

    explicit CLI flag  >  real environment variable  >  .env file  >  default

That order matters: a `.env` must never silently override something the caller
typed, and an already-exported variable (CI secret, `direnv`, a shell profile)
must never be clobbered by a file someone forgot to delete.

Nothing here is required. With no `.env` and no environment variables the
scripts behave exactly as before.
