diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku`.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old givenchy_products.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new givenchy_products.2026-09-08.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run of one category, kept under a dated
filename and diffed against the previous one to track price moves,
restocks and delistings.

Five buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new (delisted, or
                   just off this particular listing)
  changed        — sku in both, with a different tracked field
  source_changed — sku in both, whose price differs AND whose
                   `price_source` differs. Reported separately and ignored
                   by --fail-on-change, because it says something about our
                   own two readings, not about the site. See below.
  unmatched      — a row this project's parser could not recover a sku for,
                   counted rather than folded into added/removed

Why `source_changed` exists here when the transfermarkt sibling has no such
bucket: this site has FOUR ways of stating a price and they are not equally
trustworthy — a tile's microdata, a gift-set tile's bare text, a product
page's JSON-LD, and a product page's rendered price (see
output_writer.Product.price_source). A category run and a product run of the
same sku therefore read the same price through different instruments, and
so do two category runs if the site changes a tile from a set-price block to
a normal one. Reporting that as a price change would be reporting our own
instrument, which is exactly the false "price changed" CLAUDE.md §8 forbids.

There is no `--price-tolerance-pct`: every row of one run comes from one
locale and therefore one currency (`price` and `currency` are read together
from the same node), so there is no exchange-rate tick to absorb. A price on
this site moves in whole currency units, not continuously.

A run against a showcase locale (`int/en`, `ru`) has `price=None` on every
row. Diffing two of those is legitimate and reports title, availability and
delisting changes; it will simply never report a price change, because the
site publishes none.
